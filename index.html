        <h1>Our Tournaments:</h1>
        <dd><ul>
            <li>T20 Format</li>
            <dd>A T20 match is limited to a maximum of 20 overs per side, with each over consisting of six legal deliveries (bowled by the bowler). This results in a concise and action-packed game that typically lasts around three hours.</dd>
            <li>100 Balls Format</li>
            <dd>In the 100-ball format, each team faces 100 deliveries (balls) during their innings. This contrasts with the traditional Twenty20 (T20) format, which consists of 120 deliveries (20 overs of 6 balls each).</dd>
            <li>Local Tournaments</li>
            <dd>A local tournament, often referred to as a "community tournament" or "local competition," is a sporting event organized at the grassroots level within a specific geographic area or community. These tournaments are typically smaller in scale compared to national or international competitions but play a vital role in promoting sports, fostering community spirit, and providing a platform for local talent to showcase their skills. </dd>
